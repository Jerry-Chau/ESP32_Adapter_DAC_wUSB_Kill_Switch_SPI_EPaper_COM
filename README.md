# ESP32_Adapter_DAC_wUSB_Kill_Switch_SPI_EPaper_COM
These two boards allows an ESP32 to perform DAC from 0-10V using I2C and control to an E-Paper display. The main controller performs DAC using the MCP4725A0T-E/CH chip and non-inverting OpAmp. A buck converter is used to swing the DAC voltage from 0-10v using the TPS61040DBVR chip. This board is designed to be powered in a 24V system and powered on using a rocker switch. This board also allows the user to be plug into a CPU and only turn on when the switch is activated, disabling power from the CPU.
